# AgriTech-USGS-LIDAR

## Overview 
This project aims to allow you retrieve visualize USGS 3DEP lidar point cloud data.

You work at an AgriTech, which has a mix of domain experts, data scientists, data engineers. As part of the data engineering team, you are tasked to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular, your code should interface with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API.
